# Copywriting

## When This Skill Applies
- Writing headlines, taglines, and value propositions
- Creating CTAs for emails, ads, and landing pages
- Crafting ad copy within platform character limits
- Writing email subject lines and preheaders
- Developing brand messaging and key narratives

## Core Guidance

### 1. Copywriting Frameworks

#### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
- **Attention**: Hook with bold statement, question, or statistic
- **Interest**: Elaborate on the problem or opportunity
- **Desire**: Show the solution and benefits
- **Action**: Clear CTA with urgency

#### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
- **Problem**: State the audience's pain point directly
- **Agitate**: Amplify the consequences of not solving it
- **Solution**: Present your offering as the answer

#### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)
- **Before**: Current painful state
- **After**: Desired future state
- **Bridge**: How your product gets them there

#### 4Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)
- **Promise**: Bold benefit claim
- **Picture**: Vivid scenario of success
- **Proof**: Evidence (testimonials, data, case studies)
- **Push**: Urgency-driven CTA

### 2. Headline Formulas

|---------|---------|---------|
| How-to | "How to [achieve goal] without [pain]" | "How to double leads without increasing ad spend" |
| Number | "[N] ways to [benefit]" | "7 ways to reduce churn by 30%" |
| Question | "[Pain point question]?" | "Still losing customers to slow onboarding?" |
| Proof | "[Result] in [timeframe]" | "3x pipeline growth in 90 days" |
| Curiosity | "[Unexpected claim]" | "Why top marketers are abandoning email blasts" |
